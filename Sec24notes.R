##The code to create a table with player ID, their names, and their most played position:
  
  library(Lahman)
playerInfo <- Fielding %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  arrange(desc(G)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  left_join(People, by="playerID") %>%
  select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, POS)

## The code to create a table with only the ROY award winners and add their batting statistics:
  
  ROY <- AwardsPlayers %>%
  filter(awardID == "Rookie of the Year") %>%
  left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
  rename(rookie_year = yearID) %>%
  right_join(Batting, by="playerID") %>%
  mutate(AVG = H/AB) %>%
  filter(POS != "P")
  
 ### The code to keep only the rookie and sophomore seasons and remove players who did not play sophomore seasons:
    
    ROY <- ROY %>%
    filter(yearID == rookie_year | yearID == rookie_year+1) %>%
    group_by(playerID) %>%
    mutate(rookie = ifelse(yearID == min(yearID), "rookie", "sophomore")) %>%
    filter(n() == 2) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    select(playerID, rookie_year, rookie, nameFirst, nameLast, AVG)
    
## The code to calculate the proportion of players who have a lower batting average their sophomore year:
      
  mean(ROY$sophomore - ROY$rookie <= 0)
  
  ##The code to do the similar analysis on all players that played the 2013 and 2014 seasons and batted more than 130 times (minimum to win Rookie of the Year):
    
    two_years <- Batting %>%
    filter(yearID %in% 2013:2014) %>%
    group_by(playerID, yearID) %>%
    filter(sum(AB) >= 130) %>%
    summarize(AVG = sum(H)/sum(AB)) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    spread(yearID, AVG) %>%
    filter(!is.na(`2013`) & !is.na(`2014`)) %>%
    left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
    filter(POS!="P") %>%
    select(-POS) %>%
    arrange(desc(`2013`)) %>%
    select(nameFirst, nameLast, `2013`, `2014`)
  two_years  
  
  ### The code to see what happens to the worst performers of 2013:
    
arrange(two_years, `2013`)
    
## The code to see  the correlation for performance in two separate years:
  
  qplot(`2013`, `2014`, data = two_years)
